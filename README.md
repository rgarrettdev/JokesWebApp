# JokesWebApp
## ASP.NET CRUD APP

The web app also features a search functionality.

Built using C# ASP[.NET 5] core, as this provides an end to end solution.

This project uses the MVC design pattern to enforce seperation of concerns.

### Database

Object relation mapper (ORM) used to generate database tables based on classes.
This is achived via Entity Framework. 

ORM was used over Data access object simply to save time writing SQL statements.
